## Roadmap 🗺

> Stump is a very young software under active development. It has not reached a beta stage yet, so do not expect a fully featured, bug-free experience if you spin up a development environment or use a testing Docker image.

Some of these are actually completed(!) already, but the following items are the major targets for Stump's first beta release:

- 📃 Full OPDS + OPDS Page Streaming support
- 📕 EPUB, PDF, and CBZ/CBR support
- 📚 Organizing libraries with collections and reading lists
- 🔎 Versitile full-text search
- 🔐 Role-based access-control with managed user accounts and configurable privileges
- 🚀 Easy setup and deployment using Docker or bare metal
- 🤏 Small bundle size with a fully responsive, built-in UI
- 🏃 Low resource utilization with excellent performance
- 🧰 Easily consumable and documented REST API, so community tools and scripts can interact with Stump
- 🌈 And more!

I am open to suggestions and ideas, so feel free to reach out if you have anything you'd like to see!

> For more, feel free to view the [FAQ](https://stumpapp.dev/faq) page. If you're interested in tracking the development of specific features, you can take a look at the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/aaronleopold/projects/2).

## Getting Started 🚀

Stump isn't ready for normal, non-development usage yet. Once a release has been made, this will be updated. For now, follow the [Developing](#developing-) section to build from source and run locally.

There is a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aaronleopold/stump-preview) available for those interested. However, **this is only meant for testing purposes and will not be updated frequently**, so do not expect a fully featured, bug-free experience if you spin up a container.

For more information about getting started, how Stump works and how it manages your library, and much more, please visit [stumpapp.dev](https://stumpapp.dev/guides).

## Project Structure 📦

I am omitting a lot of files and only focusing on the main directories, but the following is the structure of the project:

```
.
├── apps
│   ├── client
│   │   └── src
│   └── website
│       └── src
├── core
│   ├── bindings
│   ├── prisma
│   ├── prisma-cli
│   └── src
├── README.md
└── ...
```

The `core` directory is where Stump's 'core' functionality is located, written in Rust. Stump uses [Prisma](https://github.com/Brendonovich/prisma-client-rust).

The 'apps' directory is where Stump applications are located. These are separate from the Rust core, and are individual applications:

- `client`: A React application that is served by a Stump server. This is the primary web-client for interacting with a Stump server.

- `website`: A Next.js application for the Stump landing site and documentation pages. The documentation is created using [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io/). This code gets deployed to [stumpapp.dev](http://stumpapp.dev)

## Developing 💻

Contributions are very **encouraged** and **welcome**!

I put together a small set of [resources](https://www.stumpapp.dev/contributing#developer-resources-📚) to get you started with Stump. If you're completely new to rust and/or web development, I recommend reviewing the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Getting started with React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) in that section first.

Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) beforehand. To get started, you'll need to set up your development environment.

**Ensure you are on the `develop` branch before continuing.**

### Setup Script ⚙️

> If you feel that your system is already configured for development, you may skip this step and run `cargo install cargo-watch` and `pnpm run setup`. I highly recommend using the script, however.

> **Note**: If you are on a Windows machine, you will need [Visual C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) installed on your system.

The setup script handles most of the initial configuration and installation of dependencies, however you should ensure you at least have the basics: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). The script may ask to attempt installing `pnpm` using `npm` if it is not found in your $PATH.

If you are on a Windows machine, you'll need to run the following:

```
.\.github\scripts\setup.ps1
```

Otherwise, you can run the following:

```bash
./.github/scripts/setup.sh
```

These scripts will run system checks for `cargo` and `pnpm`, and will install a few additional dependencies, depending on your system. It will then install all the direct, Stump development dependencies, build the frontend bundle (required for server to start), generate the prisma client and sqlite database.

If you face any issues running these, or are using a system that is not supported by the setup scripts, please consider [adding/improving support](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues) for your system.

### Running Stump 🏃‍♀️

To start the application for development, simply run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start both the vite dev server and the rust server, watching for changes. You can also run the server and the client in separate processes:

```bash
pnpm core dev # start the Stump server
pnpm client dev # start the web client
```

To run in a release profile, you would just need to run:

```bash
pnpm core start
```

There are a number of other projects that are similar to Stump, it certainly isn't the first or only digital book media server out there (_heck, it isn't even in beta yet_)! if Stump isn't for you, or you want to check out similar projects in the rust and/or self hosting spaces, consider checking out these other open source projects:
